# ðŸ‘Š Producer Config - retries

Deep dive into Kafka producers config `retries`

Letâ€™s say you set `acks=all` and `min.insync.replicas=2`.

For some reason, the follower goes done, then the producer identifies a failed commit because it could not get `acks` from `min.insync.replicas` brokers. An error message from the producer :point_down:

```
org.apache.kafka.common.errors.NotEnoughReplicasException
```

It means that even if the broker is running, Kafka will not append the messages to that running broker if the current ISR is not sufficient.

```commandline
The default value of retries has changed with Kafka v2.1
If using Kafka < v2.0, retries=0
If using Kafka >= v2.1, retries=2147483647 i.e. MAX_INT
```

`retries=0`

The producer will not act upon this error, so it will lose messages. This is called `at-most-once semantics`.

`retries=n`

This is basically the maximum number of retries the producer would do if the commit fails.

Users should generally prefer to leave this config unset and instead use `delivery.timeout.ms` properity to control retry behavior.

## delivery.timeout.ms

If `retries > 0`, for example, retries = 2147483647 (Kafka >= v2.1), the producer wonâ€™t try the request forever, itâ€™s bounded by a timeout. For this, you can set an intuitive Producer Timeout [(KIP-91 â€“ Kafka 2.1)](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-91+Provide+Intuitive+User+Timeouts+in+The+Producer) such as delivery.timeout.ms=120000 (= 2 minutes). Records will be failed if they canâ€™t be delivered in delivery.timeout.ms

## retry.backoff.ms

By default, the producer will wait 100ms between retries, but you can control this using the retry.backoff.ms parameter.
