# ðŸš€ Apache Kafka

We will try to simulate it with the help of real-world examples.

## What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is just like any mall that decouples seller and consumer.

> Apache Kafka allows us to decouple data streams and systems. With Apache Kafka as a data integration layer, data sources will publish their data to Apache Kafka and the target systems will source their data from Apache Kafka.

## Kafka Analogy

1. Source System/Application = Seller(clothier, grocer) | Souce system(web, mobile and cloud)
2. Producer = Who sell the goods i.e. seller(outside of mall)
3. Topic = Goods Name (Clothes, Food)
4. Brokers = Employee @ each section of Mall shop
5. Partition = Similar to category/section. Goods are broken down into sections/categories/partitions. For example -
   1. Men section,
   2. Women section,
   3. Veg section,
   4. Non-veg section
6. Offset = Index/Rack No
7. Key = Label like men, woman, veg, non-veg
8. Message = Label + Goods
9. Compression Type = Packing of goods(Box, gift, parcel)
10. Header = Metadata of Goods
11. Timestamp = A timestamp is added either by the user or the system in the message
12. Message Serializers = Representation of object(Label + Goods) in special format
13. Consumer = Who consumes the Goods i.e. customers

## Reference

1. Seller - S1 & S2
   1. S1 sells clothes i.e. clothiers.
   2. S2 sells food i.e. grocer.
2. Mall shops - MS1 & MS2
   1. MS1 is a clothes shop in the mall.
   2. MS2 is a food shop in the mall.

## Source System/Application

Who generates/produces data/goods

> In the real world, the Seller(clothier, grocer) is the application.

> In technology, Souce system(web, mobile and cloud) is application.

## Topic

Where data/goods go. Data/Goods will only move to the particular allotment.

> Web application is allocated to the web topic and mobile application is allocated to the mobile topic.

> In the same way, clothier goods will only move to the MS1(clothes shop) and grocer goods will move to MS2(Food Shop).

> Kafka topics are immutable: once data is written to a partition, it cannot be changed. t is like a non-returnable item.

## PARTITIONS

Broken down into a number of partitions

> Similar to category/section. Goods/Data are broken down into sections/categories/partitions. Here we are taking category/section for explaining purposes but in Kafka, partitions are numbered starting from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of partitions.

## Kafka Offsets & Ordering

Position of items where items are kept.

> If men's jeans are placed in rack1 of the man category at 3rd position. It is not necessary that in rack1 of the woman's category womenâ€™s jeans will be in 3rd position. It may be at rack2 at the 5th position also.

> Likewise in Kafka, If a topic has more than one partition, Kafka guarantees the order of messages within a partition, but there is no ordering of messages across partitions.

## Producer

Who sells the goods to mall/Applications that send data into topics are known as Kafka producers

> clothier who sends goods into MS1 is known as a Kafka producer. clothier typically integrated via that mall to sell goods to MS1.

> Likewise in Kafka, Applications that send data into topics are known as Kafka producers. Applications typically integrate a Kafka client library to write to Apache Kafka.

> In the real world, the seller & buyer gives some kind of acknowledgment(acks) for goods delivery. Same way in Kafka also producer must specify a level of acknowledgment(acks) for a message to be successfully written into a Kafka topic.

## Message

The message is nothing but Label + Goods. In Kafka Key + Value

## Kafka Message Anatomy

The producer creates Kafka messages. A Kafka message consists of the following elements:

![Kafka Message Structure](/assets/kafkamsg.webp)

## Message Keys

Each event message contains an optional key and a value.

> In case label/key (label/key=null) is not specified by the producer, goods are distributed evenly across categories in a round-robin fashion in the particular allotment. Suppose,

```
1. key=null, man jean comes the first time it will go to man category.
2. key=null, woman jeans come the second time it will go to woman category.
3. key=null, woman T-shirt comes 3rd time it will go to man category.
```

Likewise in Kafka, messages are distributed evenly across partitions in a topic. This means messages are sent in a round-robin fashion (partition p0 then p1 then p2, etc... then back to p0, and so on...).

> In case label/key (label/key=null) is specified by the producer.
> All goods that share the same label will always be sent and stored in the same category.

```
1. key=man, man jean comes the first time it will go to man category.
2. key=woman, woman jeans come the second time it will go to woman category.
3. key=woman, woman T-shirt comes 3rd time it will go to woman category.
```

all messages that share the same key will always be sent and stored in the same Kafka partition.

> Kafka message keys are commonly used when there is a need for message ordering for all messages sharing the same field.

## Message Value

The goods/content of the message can be null.

## Message Compression Type

Packing of goods(Box, gift, parcel)/Compressed

> The compression type can be specified as part of the message. Options are none, gzip, lz4, snappy, and zstd.

## Message Headers

Metadata of goods/message

> Specify metadata about the goods/message, especially for tracing.

## Message Topic + Partition + Offset

The combination of topic + partition + offset uniquely identifies the message.

## Kafka Message Serializers

Representation of the object(Label(Key) + Goods(Message)) in special format

> Just like, In clothes shop introduce the special format of goods and employee understands that special format for items @ each section of MS1.

> Likewise in Kafka, Kafka brokers expect byte arrays as keys and values of messages.

```
We have a message with an Integer key and a String value. Since the key is an integer,
we have to use an IntegerSerializer to convert it into a byte array.
For the value, since it is a string, we must leverage a StringSerializer.
```

## Message Key Hashing

Key Hashing is the process of determining the mapping of a key to a partition

> Clothier defines such a mechanism that mechanism will determine which goods to which mall shop.

> A Kafka partitioner is a code logic that takes a record and determines to which partition to send it.

## Consumers

Who consume the Goods/Data

> When you go to the mall and purchase those clothes according to your need. It is called a consumer. In the same way, Applications that read data from Kafka topics are known as consumers.

> Consumers typically integrated via that the mall to consume goods from MS1. Applications integrate a Kafka client library to read from Apache Kafka.

`Note: Clothier & Consumer are not part of the mall. They are connected through the mall. Likewise, Kafka producers and consumers are also connected through the Kafka client library to read from/ write to Apache Kafka`.
